# AdventureWorks

Our version of [Microsofts AdventureWorks2019 database](https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure) runs in SQLite, making it easy to import into Python.

The scripts (`scripts`) for creating the SQLite database were created using the tool [SQLite & SQL Server Compact Toolbox](https://github.com/ErikEJ/SqlCeToolbox). The file `adventure-works.db` contains all contents of the original AdventureWorks2019 database in a "ready for SQLite" format.
